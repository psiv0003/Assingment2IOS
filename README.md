# Photo-Booth

This is a photo editor app, wherein the images can be edited based on the readings obtained from the IoT devices. We have used a RaspberryPI3 along with Temperature and Colour Sensors in this project.

Based off the temperature readings from the devices, stickers can be added to the images. This can be either images or just the latest temperature reading. Lastly, a colour layer can also be added to the image. This would be the colour obtained from the Colour sensors.

The IoT side of things was developed using Python. The iOS app was developed using Swift 5
